budgie-next
-----------

This tree will be used for the exploratory stages for the next major version of the Budgie Desktop.

As a high level overview, we essentially want to achieve the following:

 - Pure C11 implementation (No transpilers)
 - Stable ABI definition
 - Rich UI via `libsolus-ui`
 - Easier C with `libsolus` (less boilerplate)

Component overview
------------------

The new architecture will initially consist of the following components to enable a quicker TTM

**libsolus**:

Convenience functionality common to C programs using modern standards.

**libsolus-ui**:

Extends upon GTK+ to provide the ability to create rich UIs for both the desktop itself and applications.

**budgie-panel**:

The main panel component of the desktop. The process consists of a manager, multiple panels and the Raven UI. Each panel is a toplevel `GtkWindow` expressing the DOCK EWMH hint.
